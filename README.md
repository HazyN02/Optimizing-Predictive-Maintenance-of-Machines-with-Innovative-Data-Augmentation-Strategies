# Optimizing Predictive Maintenance with Innovative Data Augmentation

## Overview
This project explores advanced data augmentation strategies for predictive maintenance in industrial environments. A key challenge in predictive maintenance is the scarcity of diverse and balanced fault data, as real-world machine failures are rare. To address this, we propose a hybrid augmentation framework using **GANs, VAEs, and traditional time-series techniques** to generate realistic synthetic fault data, improving the accuracy and robustness of predictive models.

## Motivation
- **Data scarcity** limits predictive model reliability.  
- **Synthetic fault scenarios** enable better generalization.  
- **Reduced downtime and costs** through proactive maintenance.  
- **Improved safety and reliability** for industrial systems.  

## Objectives
- Minimize unplanned downtime through accurate failure prediction.  
- Develop augmentation methods tailored for time-series sensor data.  
- Train models on combined real + synthetic datasets for better fault detection.  
- Validate effectiveness of generated data using statistical and visual methods.  
- Ensure adaptability across multiple industrial domains.  

## Tools & Technologies
- **Programming**: Python  
- **ML/DL Frameworks**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch  
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy  
- **Time-Series Analysis**: Statsmodels, Prophet  
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly  
- **Cloud & Storage**: SQL/NoSQL databases, Google Cloud  

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing** â€“ Dimensionality reduction (PCA), scaling, cleaning.  
2. **Synthetic Data Generation** â€“ WGAN & CWGAN for realistic sensor data.  
3. **Validation** â€“ KS test, Wasserstein distance, KDE, t-SNE, anonymity scores.  
4. **Labeling** â€“ Remaining Useful Life (RUL) calculation.  
5. **Model Training** â€“ Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting.  
6. **Evaluation** â€“ RMSE, RÂ² score, real vs synthetic dataset comparisons.  

## Results
- Synthetic data achieved comparable or superior performance to real data.  
- Models trained on augmented datasets showed improved **fault detection accuracy** and **robustness**.  

## Applications
